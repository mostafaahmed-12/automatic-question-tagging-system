# automatic-question-tagging-system
Sitesthat are specifically designed to have questions
and answers for their users like Quora and
Stackoverflow often request their users to submit five
words along with the question so that they can be
categorized easily. But, sometimes users provide
wrong tags which makes it difficult for other users to
navigate through. Thus, they require an automatic
question tagging system that can automatically
identify correct and relevant tags for a question
submitted by the user.
